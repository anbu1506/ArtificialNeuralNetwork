it's a simple ANN implemented for Classification problem from scratch using numpy .

by going through it , we can easily understand the mathematics  behind neural networks

here is a basic overview:

  1. forward propogation ----  Linear Algebra (linear equatons , dot products , matrix multiplications )
  2. cost function       ----  Statistics (Binary cross entropy)
  3. optimization        ----  Calculus (Gradient Descent - partial derivatives)
